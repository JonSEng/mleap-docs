# Getting Started

Whether using MLeap with PySpark, Scikit-learn, Spark, Tensorflow, or
MLeap, getting started is easy. For the most part, everything you will
need is already in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/) or
[PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). If you are trying to get up and
running with Tensorflow transformers, you will either have to build some
of your own jar files or download them from [Combust
Maven](http://maven.combust.ml).

Experimenting with MLeap is easy to do either through an interactive
Scala console or preferably a notebook, whether from [Databricks](https://databricks.com/)
or [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/).
