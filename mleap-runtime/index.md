# Basic Usage

MLeap aims to be as simple as possible to use, here are some of our core
principles when we design our APIs.

1. Use monadic programming as much as possible
2. Stay clean with automatic resource management
3. Report useful errors
4. Make operations on leap frames and transformers as natural and simple
   as possible

A lot of magic goes into making the API user-friendly, but you don't
have to worry about any of it unless you want to.

Let's start off with some basic usage of MLeap, like creating a leap
frame, modifying it, and finally using transformers and pipelines for
full-fledged ML pipeline transformations.
